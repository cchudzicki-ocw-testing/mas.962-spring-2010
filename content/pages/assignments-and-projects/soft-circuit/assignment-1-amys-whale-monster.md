_By Amy LeMessurier  
_

When I saw the stroke sensor in class last Wednesday, I immediately thought of some kind of stuffed animal that senses when it's being touched. I started by making the sensor, then constructed the monster (whale? hedgehog?) around that piece. The output when the stroke sensor is touched is a single LED in one of the monster's eyes. Surprisingly (considering the tangle of thread on the inside), it actually works! At first, I connected everything the wrong way, but I figured it out eventually. I embroidered the face on my sewing machine using free-form stitching. I also attached the buttons I made in class last Wednesday to the tail, mostly so that I could use the battery pack attached to it without taking apart the buttons. When you push the buttons on the tail, each one lights up an LED.
